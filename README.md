# Descision_Tree_DrugDataset_python
## Algorithm
 We used this classification algorithm (Descision Tree) to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then we used decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
## Dataset
 The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.It is a sample of binary classifier, and we can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe it to a new patient.

## libraries
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit learn
## language programing
- python
## Conclusion
with this model we can predict 0.98 class of a new patiant correctly
